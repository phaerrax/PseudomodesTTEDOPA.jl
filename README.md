# PseudomodesTTEDOPA

This package is deprecated.
Its features have been split in three different packages:

* [TEDOPA](https://github.com/phaerrax/TEDOPA.jl) for the chain-mapping
  functionality;
* [LindbladVectorizedTensors](https://github.com/phaerrax/LindbladVectorizedTensors.jl)
  for the ITensors site type definitions and functions;
* [MarkovianClosure](https://github.com/phaerrax/MarkovianClosure.jl) for the
  Markovian closure constructions.

This package will remain available, but it won't receive updates anymore.
